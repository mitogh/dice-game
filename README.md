## Game Rules: ##

The dice game is called "Pig" and is a simple two-player game. The rules and more information about the game can be found [here on its Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28dice_game%29), but the simple rules are as follows:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
